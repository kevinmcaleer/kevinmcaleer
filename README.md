- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevinmcaleer
- 👀 I design and build robots, make videos about them on YouTube, bring them to life with code and have a whole load of fun along the way
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and MicroPython
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with Robotics, though my time and focus is limited (Hobby time)
